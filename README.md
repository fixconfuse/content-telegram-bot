## üöÄ What can it do? 


This Telegram bot is provided by lemon.markets to showcase one of the many use-cases of the API. This bot can be used to place trades on your own lemon.markets
account and gain an overview of your portfolio. The available commands are: `/start`, `/trade`, `/quicktrade`, `/portfolio` and `/moon`.
